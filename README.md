## ASCII Tetris in Ada
An ASCII implementation of the Tetris game in the Ada language.

You can easily compile and play it with `gnatmake`, which comes out of the box with `gcc` compiler.
```
gnatmake tetris.adb
```
And then just run it.

You can also use Make (`gnatmake` is still necessary):
```
make build && make run
```
